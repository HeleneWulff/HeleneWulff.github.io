<!-- I have chosen the context of "Music Video"
and in the following I will highlight my three main goals for the site:

1. I want to make the music video the main focus on the site.
2. I want to make a list next to the music video containing other videos by the same artist.
3. I want to make a timeline of the artist's career underneath.  -->
