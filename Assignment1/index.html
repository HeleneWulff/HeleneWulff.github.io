    <h2>Initial impression</h2>

          What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
          the experience?
        </h4>
        <p>
          The first thing I paid attention to when interacting with
          broomstick.com was the colour palette used. The shades of blue, green,
          and grey make it easy to distinguish one element from another while
          creating cohesiveness through the page. This is supported by different
          textures and shapes within each colour which brings the page to life.
        </p>

          Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
          your discrete actions.
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The first “slide” of the page contains a header with four clicking
            options that leads to different parts of the page.
          </li>
          <li>Reading the small portions of text throughout the page.</li>
          <li>Scrolling down the page and noticing animated elements.</li>
          <li>
            The part of the page regarding “Paintings” slides sideways when I
            scroll downwards.
          </li>
          <li>
            Only the last to “slides” of the page contains clicking options
            besides the header in the first slide. The heart to “send rays of
            kindness”, the dumpster with the sign “Clean where there is no
            littering!” and the option to share the page elsewhere.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is possible to drag the trash on the last slide around, but they
            always fall back into their initial spot.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scrolling sideways is not possible. The page moves a little to make
            it clear that it cannot move any further. Scrolling downwards is the
            only option.
          </li>
        </ul>

          What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I spend most time reading the story that the page presents while
          appreciating elements moving around to support it. I especially
          focused on the part of the page regarding what would happen to the
          planet without the wiper. I also spend time on trying to figure out
          why I could drag the trash around on the last slide and not put it in
          the dumpster to “help” the wiper.

          What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
          the experience?
        </h4>
        <p>
          The most common action in my two minute interaction with
          Broomstick.com was scrolling down the page as this is the only way to
          access each slide and enable the moving elements of the page. If
          reading the story of the page counts as an action, then this would
          also be one of the most common.
        </p>

    <h2>Intended goals</h2>
    <h4 class="different">
      What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
      experience?
    </h4>
    <p>
      My impression of the intended primary goal of Broomstick.com was to
      express the value of janitors and wipers and how most people take their
      work for granted. The last slide also explicitly states the “Purpose of
      the site” to be: “To show the importance and value of professions, so that
      “working” professions are not treated with prejudice, but on the contrary
      appreciate the labor of others”. So my impression of the primary goals
      aligns with the project authors intention.
    </p>
    <h4 class="different">
      How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Broomstick.com communicates the primary goal by telling a story through
      the page. The story contains of historical facts, empathy appealing
      messages and conjectures about a world without the work of janitors and
      wipers. One of the visual effects I noticed is how the janitor on the
      first slide is completely unknown as his figure consists of grey checkers,
      which in the digital world can mean that this part is transparent. When
      the janitor is showed for the last time further down the page, he suddenly
      has the same texture as everyone else where his face, clothes, etc. are
      visible. This aligns with that specific part of the story, where the focus
      is on remembering to show gratitude for the janitorial profession.
    </p>

    <h4 class="different">
      What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
      over time? (For how long and how many different times)
    </h4>
    <p>
      My impression of how Broomstick.com should be interacted with over time is
      reflected in the statement on the last slide of the page saying: “The
      project was realized as part of a course on layout and animation”.
      Broomstick.com will probably not become a frequently used website, as the
      future use of the page is to read the same story again. It therefore makes
      sense that the website was a project in a course on layout and animation
      and that visual elements were the first I noticed about the page.
    </p>

    <h4 class="different">
      How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
      interacted with over time?
    </h4>
    <p>
      As mentioned in the above citation, Broomstick.com was created as a part
      of a course on layout and animation. This emphasizes my impression that
      the page does not invite multiple visits. However, it can be argued that
      certain elements of the page can make people revisit the website. One of
      these elements could be the historical facts regarding the janitorial
      profession. These might be useful later for the right person. Another
      element could be the combination of aesthetically pleasing visuals and the
      message of the page that makes it memorable and a place to revisit and
      show to others.
    </p>

    <h2>Media forms referenced</h2>
    <h4 class="different">
      What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
      reference?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Paper can be seen as a medium for communication, and multiple elements on
      Broomstick.com resembles paper. Most of the background is crumpled in the
      way paper crumples and some of the slides are created with a “scrapbook
      effect”, where it looks like it is a physical page ripped from somewhere
      else. Furthermore, a part of the website more explicitly resembles a
      newspaper with a headline and multiple news articles underneath. There are
      also digital media referenced on the website with possibility to send the
      project author a telegram or visit her profile on Instagram.
    </p>

    <h4 class="different">
      What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
      when engaging with your research experience?
    </h4>
    <p>
      The reference of the paper medium can be seen as supporting the main
      action of reading through the page - like reading a paper or a book.
    </p>

    <h4 class="different">
      What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel
      when engaging with your research experience?
    </h4>
    <p>
      The reference of reading a paper or a book communicates to me that I
      should be focused on taking the story in. I am reading this to understand
      it and remember it. The previous mentioned visual effect of the janitor
      being transparent at first and visible at the end also connects with the
      paper reference by enhancing the “storyline”.
    </p>

    <h2>Frustrating vs. Satisfying</h2>
    <h4 class="different">
      What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes
      that part frustrating?
    </h4>
    <p>
      The most frustrating part of the interaction was on the last slide where
      there is a dumpster and a lot of trash. For the first time on the website,
      it is possible to drag the elements around which to me felt like I should
      be able to do something with them. It was also possible to open the
      dumpster and it seemed obvious that I was meant to drag the trash into the
      dumpster. This action was not possible – whatever I did, the elements kept
      reversing to their original spot. This was a little frustrating and the
      possibility to drag the items around seemed useless.
    </p>

    <h4 class="different">
      What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes
      that part satisfying?
    </h4>
    <p>
      To me the whole page is aesthetically pleasing which is satisfying by
      itself. A part of the page that I especially found satisfying was when
      trash was used at the bottom of one slide for the janitor to clean, and
      then “rains” from the top of the following slide over the Taj Mahal. That
      was a satisfying bridge between the two slides.
