    <h2>Initial impression</h2>
    <p>
      <h4 class="different">What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
        experience?</h4>
      The first thing I paid attention to when interacting with
      broomstick.com was the colour palette used. The shades of blue, green, and
      grey make it easy to distinguish one element from another while creating
      cohesiveness through the page. This is supported by different textures and
      shapes within each colour which brings the page to life.

        <h4 class="different">Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>The first “slide” of the page contains a header with four clicking options that leads to different parts of the page.</li>
        <li>Reading the small portions of text throughout the page.</li>
        <li>Scrolling down the page and noticing animated elements.</li>
        <li>The part of the page regarding “Paintings” slides sideways when I scroll downwards.</li>
        <li>Only the last to “slides” of the page contains clicking options besides the header in the first slide. The heart to “send rays of kindness”, the dumpster with the sign “Clean where there is no littering!” and the option to share the page elsewhere.</li>
        <li>It is possible to drag the trash on the last slide around, but they always fall back into their initial spot.</li>
        <li>Scrolling sideways is not possible. The page moves a little to make it clear that it cannot move any further. Scrolling downwards is the only option.</li>
    </ul>
